These projects are a mix of practical tools, repairs, and challenging designs.

Cryptex         - A locking puzzle box, intended to be opened by the correct word rather than a numeric code. Was quite challenging to ensure it printed with sufficient gap for assembly without noticable play when any section is correct.

CurtainBrace    - Mounting brace for non destructive attachment of a heavy curtain to a doorless frame.

Engine          -  A working model steam engine using a switch plate rather than a valve to regulate flow alternation. Lack of fly wheel is still an issue at lower speeds. Printing was a challenge as it needed to be airtight but still capable of assembly and dissasembly. For example the switch plate needed to freely move but not allow too much air to escape along its length.

HeadsetRepair   - Parts to repair a shattered headset, needed very exact fit to work aloong with sufficient flexibility.

HyroponicTower  - First attempts at a dripping water style hyrdopoic tower. This sits in a heavy bucket of water with a small pump maintaining a continous sprinkle of water from the top. Aimed for modularity and ease of dissasembly for cleaning. Still quite material intensive, future redesigns will aim to remove and narrow most of the surrounding walls.

RamenPlanter    - Plant pot shaped like a takeout container

WindowLock      - Brace to fix a thick bay window open. Effectively extends the existing male and female locking system without needing additional materials or fasteners. Some issues with warping on long term use.
