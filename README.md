This repository acts as an archive and portfolio of my CAD and FEA projects, both academic and personal.

Each project folder contains a png showcasing the design along with a f3d file, Fusion 360's native storage medium. An STL is also provided for compatibility and ease of use. Where appropriate a drawing file is also included.
