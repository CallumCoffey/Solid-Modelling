Both of these projects were completed as part of my Bachelors of Biomedical Engineering.

The Custom Hip Stem is a ground up design of a hip stem aiming to create an ideal and physiologically realistic implant followed by simulating its performance.
Design was iterated on the results of the FEA.

The Scan Based Hip Replacement uses a segmentation derived from a patient CT scan to guide the design of a total hip replacement.
