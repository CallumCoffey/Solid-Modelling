My undergraduate thesis focussed on a design methodology for developing a custom prosthetic based on a patient scan.

A 3D scan was performed on a mold of the patients hand and the postprocessed STL was used to guide the prosthetic design.

The original model is the Unlimbited Phoenix hand V2. This design can be found at https://enablingthefuture.org/phoenix-hand/.
The patients hand morphology meant they were incapable of using it as is.

My redesign required changing from a gauntlet to a watch style tensioner, adding another 'knuckle', complete redesign of the fingers, adjustment of hand geometry, removal of the thumb, and changing from a molded plate to a buckle style fastener.

Three FEA studies were performed, impact on the hand, loading of the hand, and loading of the tensioner.

The impact study simulated a sudden distributed force on the fingers to mimic a fall.
The hand loading tested different grip diamters and different loading weights.
The tensioner loading tested different levels of tightning as this also determines the overlap between screw and rod.
